CARE-NET AI
    Care-Net: An Agentic AI Network for Rural Health Awareness

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In rural areas, many people lack awareness about:
•	When a health issue is minor or urgent
•	Where nearby government hospitals or PHCs are located
•	Availability of free healthcare schemes
•	Safe use of common medicines
This often leads to delayed treatment, unnecessary expenses, and avoidable health risks.
There is a need for a safe, simple, and intelligent AI system that provides early guidance and awareness, especially for populations with low medical and digital literacy.

SOLUTION OVERVIEW:
CARE-NET AI combines:
•	Machine Learning for symptom pattern analysis
•	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for trusted healthcare information
•	Agentic AI for decision-making and orchestration
The system guides users on:
•	Severity level of symptoms
•	When to seek medical help
•	Nearby government healthcare resources
•	Safe medicine-related information

Why Rural Healthcare?
Rural healthcare was chosen because:
•	Medical infrastructure is limited
•	Awareness gaps are more critical than technology gaps
•	Even basic guidance can prevent serious outcomes
•	Most existing AI healthcare tools target urban, educated users
CARE-NET AI is designed to work with:
•	Simple inputs
•	Local language support (future scope)
•	Intermediaries like ASHA workers or rural clinic assistants

ETHICAL ASSUMPTIONS & SAFETY:
The following ethical assumptions guide this project:
•	The system does not provide medical diagnosis
•	The system does not prescribe medicines or treatments
•	Clear disclaimers are included in all outputs
•	The system only offers preliminary guidance and awareness
•	Users are encouraged to consult qualified healthcare professionals
This project is intended as a decision-support and awareness tool, not a replacement for medical experts.

DATA SOURCES / DATA LINK:
This project uses publicly available and non-sensitive datasets:
Symptom–Condition Dataset (Kaggle)
Used for training the symptom analysis ML model
       https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/choongqianzheng/disease-and-symptoms-dataset

Public Healthcare Information (Government & Open Data)
Used for RAG-based retrieval of:
•	PHCs
•	Government hospitals
•	Healthcare schemes
No personal health information (PHI) is used.
